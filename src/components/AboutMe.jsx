        <p>My name is Michael Bullock. I am a current Senior Billing Analyst, based in Austin, TX, seeking
                opportunities to utilize my coding skills. I am passionate on continuing my learning in the field. As it relates to my
                specific interest, I enjoy working on front-end development which utilizes my creative outlets. I
                obtained knowledge in the coding realm from the University of Texas - Austin
                Bootcamp. In my current role, I utilize SQL to pull applicable data from the company's database to track and
                visualize KPIs for the team.</p>
